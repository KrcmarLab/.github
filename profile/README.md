### Welcome to KrcmarLab

 - We would like to keep the code associated with [KrcmarLab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/bpm/krcmar/) here.
 - You can add your code repositories here, if you work at the KrcmarLab.
 - We try to follow a [Forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) in this organisation.
 - So you can have your production code here, fork it to your account, make a feature branch, make commits, and send a pull request to the repository here.
 - Test and merge the pull request in the organisation repository using the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67311431).
 - Please create project boards for your individual repositories. You can track backlog, issues etc. better.
 - Feel free to contact [Somesh Khandelia](https://github.com/someshkhandelia) in case of any issues.
